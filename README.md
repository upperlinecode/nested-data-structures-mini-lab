## Nesting Habits

Arrays inside of arrays! Hashes inside of hashes! Arrays inside of hashes! Hashes inside of arrays inside of hashes! Oh my!

### 1: Arrays in Arrays
```ruby
sandwich = [["rye", "sourdough", "baguette"],[["ham", "salami", "turkey"],["swiss", "munster", "cheddar"]],["mayo", "mustard", "tabasco"]]
```
The `sandwich` array above is a series of nested arrays. What do I get if I ask for:
+ `sandwich[0][1]` ?
+ `sandwich[1]` ?
+ `sandwich[1][0][0]` ?

What code should I write to return each of these?:
+ ["mayo", "mustard", "tabasco"]
+ "cheddar"
+ "sourdough"

Make me a salami sandwich with swiss cheese on rye bread with mustard and mayo. Thank you.

### 2: Hashes in Hashes
```
city_info = {
		:new_york => { 
			:mayor => "Bill DeBlasio",
			:population => 8337000,
			:website => "http://www.nyc.gov"
			},
		:los_angeles => { 
			:mayor => "Eric Garcetti",
			:population => 3884307,
			:website => "http://www.lacity.org"
			},
		:miami => { 
			:mayor => "Tomás Regalado",
			:population => 419777,
			:website => "http://www.miamigov.com"
			},
		:chicago => { 
			:mayor => "Rahm Emanuel",
			:population => 2695598,
			:website => "http://www.cityofchicago.org/"
			}
		}
```
The `city_info` hash above is a series of nested hashes. What do I get returned if I ask for:
+ `city_info[:los_angeles]` ?
+ `city_info[:chicago][:mayor]` ?

What code should I write to return each of these?:
+ The population of New York
+ The website for Miami city government
+ The mayor of Los Angeles
+ A hash with all information on Chicago

Bonus: Use an `each` loop with another `each` loop to `puts` a string for each key value pair belonging to a city. For example, for Miami you should see:

```
"The mayor of miami is Tomás Regalado"
"The population of miami is 419777"
"The website of miami is http://www.miamigov.com"
```
